This application is a simple calendar that runs in the browser. It features a dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. A user can input and save tasks for each hour of the day, and return to the application to review those tasks.

This calendar application features:
1. The current day at the top of the page.
2. Standard business hour timeblocks.
3. The ability to enter a task for a given timeblock, and save that information by clicking the save icon.
4. Upon refreshing the page, previously entered tasks persist in the associated timeblock.
5. As the day progresses, the timeblocks change color depending on the current time to indicate if a task is in the past, present, or future.
